			General information about Umea
		</h1>
		<p>
			The city of Umea is quite a bit different to Sassenheim and other Dutch cities. The first and most apparent difference is that everything is just more spread out. Every household has access to quite some space but important places like the city centre are still easily accessible, via bike, scooter, or car. It only takes a ten-minute drive from the city centre to reach thick spruce forests. This was quite spectacular to see.<br>
			Umea is also known as the city of birches. In the city, there are birches everywhere. I asked my exchange family why that is the case and they told me that there was a huge fire in the city around two hundred years ago. This fire destroyed almost the whole city and left a huge scar on the population. To prevent this from happening again the government decided to plant birches instead of spruces. They did this because are quite moist inside and thus do not catch on fire as easily compared to spruces. Those birches are still present up until this day.<br>
			There a lot of schools located in Umea. The city is known as the education capital of Sweden. A large part of the population are young people, who go to Umea to study. We went to the big campus which even includes a large scientific hospital. Apart from that almost all professions are covered here. The school we went to was also quite big; The first couple of days we struggled with finding the way. The school system in Sweden is a bit different than what we are used to. After what we call high school, most students go to 'Gymnasiet'. Here they get to choose a subject they want focus more on; For my exchange student that is Social studies and People science.<br>
			According to my opinion, the food in Sweden is just amazing. It is like they took every food that tastes good from across the world and used it in their culture. Examples are tacos and pizza, they do give these recipes a little twist by putting banana on it. Seems weird, but actually tastes better than you would think. Swedish people also eat a lot of wild meat, for example in stews. Moose stew was one of my favourites.

				<h1>Sweden</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Hot food for lunch</h3>
						<p>
							In Sweden, people are used to eating hot food for lunch. So even in school, hot food is served entirely for free. The government of Umea even tries to make sure this food is made in a sustainable way. They do this by, for example, making sure the food is locally sourced and mostly vegan.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Freedom</h3>
						<p>
							People in Sweden seem to just care less about stuff. This is a bit hard to explain but they just seem to do anything they want. This lifestyle seems nice. You can just go exploring or chilling in nature, this is something which I could really get used to.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Everything is paid with taxes</h3>
						<p>
							In Sweden, tax is very high. This does have a very good reason though. This way, you pay for almost everything via taxes, health care insurance and education costs for example. This way the government makes sure everyone has access to these basic needs. However, some people have criticised this system. They want to make the decisions themselves and have a higher pay check.

				<h1>The Netherlands</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Sandwiches for lunch</h3>
						<p>
							Dutch people are used to eating sandwiches for lunch. We put all sorts of stuff on it, things like 'hagelslag', cheese and much more. We can buy food at school but there is no real thought in making sure that this food is made in sustainable ways.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Lack of freedom</h3>
						<p>
							In the Netherlands it is harder to really immerse yourself into nature. The only big piece of nature located nearby the area of Sassenheim are the dunes, which are just not a spectacular as Swedish nature. This contributes a lot to our lack of freedom, there is just no place to go and have fun without anyone caring.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Basic tax system</h3>
						<p>
							The Dutch tax system is quite basic; It is similar to the systems of other European countries. We pay for things like road maintenance and our social security system. Although health care insurances are mandatory, we do have to pay for them. This is working quite well for the Dutch population.

		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p>
			In Sweden everything seems less pointed at wealth and successfulness of the country, but more at the general well-being of the population, freedom and comfort. This in turn results in the country doing better because people are happier with their governors. The government shows a lot of initiative to prevent global warming instead of not really doing anything big about it. The laidback way of living in Sweden seems lazy at first, but this actually results in way better quality of life.<br>
			In the Netherlands everything is a bit more managed, I guess. What I mean by this is that we are a bit stricter and more direct. Take our school system for example. We are 'penalized' quite often with homework and systems like 'yellow cards'. In Sweden, you have my responsibility for yourself. This, eventually, will have more effect than Dutch ways. I do think the new RLS-flex system will help with this a lot but the base idea is still the same.<br>
			If I could choose, I would prefer to live in Sweden. The Netherlands is alright, but I would really enjoy the amount freedom people are used to in Sweden.
