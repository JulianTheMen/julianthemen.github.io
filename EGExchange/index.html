			General information about Umea
		</h1>
		<p>
			The city of Umea is quite a bit different to Sassenheim and other Dutch cities. The first and most apparent difference is that everything is just more spread out. Every household has access to quite some space but important places like the city centre are still easily accessible, via bike, scooter, or car. It only takes a ten-minute drive from the city centre to reach thick spruce forests. This was quite spectacular to see.<br>
			Umea is also known as the city of birches. In the city, there are birches everywhere. I asked my exchange family why that is the case and they told me that there was a huge fire in the city around two hundred years ago. This fire destroyed almost the whole city and left a huge scar on the population. To prevent this from happening again the government decided to plant birches instead of spruces. They did this because are quite moist inside and thus do not catch on fire as easily compared to spruces. Those birches are still present up until this day.<br>
			There a lot of schools located in Umea. The city is known as the education capital of Sweden. A large part of the population are young people, who go to Umea to study. We went to the big campus which even includes a large scientific hospital. Apart from that almost all professions are covered here. The school we went to was also quite big; The first couple of days we struggled with finding the way. The school system in Sweden is a bit different than what we are used to. After what we call high school, most students go to 'Gymnasiet'. Here they get to choose a subject they want focus more on; For my exchange student that is Social studies and People science.

				<h1>Sweden</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Hot food for lunch</h3>
						<p>
							In Sweden, people are used to eating hot food for lunch. So even in school, hot food is served entirely for free. The government of Umea even tries to make sure this food is made in a sustainable way. They do this by, for example, making sure the food is locally sourced and mostly vegan.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Freedom</h3>
						<p>
							People in Sweden seem to just care less about stuff. This is a bit hard to explain but they just seem to do anything they want. This lifestyle seems nice. You can just go exploring or chilling in nature, this is something which I could really get used to.

				<h1>The Netherlands</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Sandwiches for lunch</h3>
						<p>
							Dutch people are used to eating sandwiches for lunch. We put all sorts of stuff on it, things like 'hagelslag', cheese and much more. We can buy food at school but there is no real thought in making sure that this food is made in sustainable ways.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Lack of freedom</h3>
