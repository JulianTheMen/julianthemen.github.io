			<h2>What is the meaning of the distinction between left-wing, centre and right-wing? Why is it sometimes hard to make this distinction?</h2>
			In the political spectrum you have two certain sides, in this case left-wing and right wing. The spectrum speaks about what view you have for politics; it defines your opinion. The political definition of left-wing is refereeing to a certain group whose opinion tends to be more liberal and usually support more progressive policy. In contrast to right-wing, which is more conservative. Centre means that is in the middle of both, a combination between liberal and conservative opinions. It is sometimes quite hard to distinguish them from each other because those 3 forms of ideologies have always got something in common and they are sometimes hard to recognize.  
			The main difference between progressive and conservative is that progressive looks at the new developments and change, while conservatives like to go back to the past and don’t change. The two ideologies have also major differences in ideas of things. A good example is the climate change, conservatives don’t really want to invest into the climate whilst the progressivists support the idea of investing in the climate.
