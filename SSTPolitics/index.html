			<h2>The distinction between left-wing, centre and right-wing</h2>
			In the political spectrum, you have two certain sides, in this case, left-wing and right-wing. The spectrum speaks about what view you have for politics; it defines your opinion. The political definition of left-wing is referring to a certain group whose opinion tends to be more liberal and usually support more progressive policy. In contrast to the right-wing, which is more conservative. Centre means that is in the middle of both, a combination of liberal and conservative opinions. It is sometimes quite hard to distinguish them from each other because those three forms of ideologies have always got something in common and they are sometimes hard to recognize.<br>
			The main difference between progressive and conservative is that progressive looks at the new developments and change, while conservatives like to go back to the past and do not change. The two ideologies have some major differences in ideas of things. A good example is climate change, conservatives do not necessarily want to invest in the climate whilst the progressivists support the idea of investing in the climate.<br>
			<h2>What stood out in the elections of 2021</h2>
			The Dutch elections of 2021 were kind of a rollercoaster, with lots of drama and trouble. Most of the votes were mainly centred and the biggest political party was VVD, which is centre-right on the political spectrum. As usual, some parties suffered great losses (groenlinks) while others had huge victories (D66).
			<br>
			The cabinet formation was quite the issue, after a vast number of days, three hundred days, the formation of Rutte IV was formed. The VVD worked together with D66, CDA and CU. You may not know this, but all those political parties are more centred on the political spectrum. The main difference is in the are the progressive and conservative views of the parties. D66 is extremely progressive while the CU tends to be quite conservative.
			<br>
			It was still a question if Mark Rutte would score good as a candidate there were a lot of trouble last few years with him. Even very recently the childcare benefits scandal. Anyhow, Rutte managed to stay on top with a staggering 20 % of the voters, which is two million people who voted for Mark Rutte as prime minister.<br>
			<h2>How our electrocal system works and how it is different from other systems</h2>
			The electoral system is a certain political system that a country has. The Netherlands has a proportional representation electoral system. The system works quite straight forward, every 4 years in March there is the election for the representatives of a party. To receive a seat in the second Chambre you need at least 0,67% of the votes. If you have a seat in the chamber, you have a say in all the decisions that the second chamber makes, the more seats you have the more power you got. Besides the party you can vote on, you can also vote on a certain representative. When you vote you will get a white piece of paper with multiple parties on it, then also a list of the representatives on whom you can vote as well. Everyone in the Netherlands can have a political party, but to be able to stand on the final piece of vote paper (also called a ballot) you must pay a registration fee of 450 euros to be able to participate in the election for the second chamber.
			<br>
			Other countries have various kinds of electoral systems, take the example as France. France, they have got a district electoral system. You will have multiple districts in a country, you could compare them to provinces (like what we have in the Netherlands). Every district will have a certain representative seat, so in every district, there will be an election for one seat in the parliament. The party with the most districts as their favourite choice will be the prime minister.<br>
			<h2>What are the main themes of our present cabinet?</h2>
			The ''regeerakkoord'' of 2021 was quite something, with a total amount of forty-seven pages full of text it was settled. On the 15th of December 2021. It was constructed by cabinet formation, Rutte IV.
			<br>
			To say that climate change is nowadays a big issue is a fact, as well as in politics they have difficulties facing it. And thus, it was one of the main topics for the ''regeerakkoord'' with multiple opinions crashing into each other, the progressive mind of D66 which supports the climate change investments. While the VVD tends to be more in favour of keeping the side of the companies and their profitable greenhouse effects. Like coal industries. And so, you have quite the climate debate. Eventually, they settled, and a major fund was brought out to support the climate change agreement.
			<br>
			Furthermore, healthcare, and international affairs were a few important bullet points. Health care especially during this time, covid-19. A severe problem for the coming time. And international affairs play a significant role. The EU deals and immigrant rules were some tight issues for this current cabinet.
			<br>
			<h2>Historical events that have been essential for the development of our resent politcal system</h2>
			Since 1815 The Netherlands has had a monarchy. The monarch is the head of the state and is controlled by the constitution. The Dutch constitution has existed since 1814 and has been changed a lot since its establishment. One very important change in our constitution was introduced by Thorbecke. The change in the constitution meant that the monarch had to give his power to parliamentary majorities, which would give the citizens more rights and more saying in their future. This was the first step to democracy. After some political conflicts in 1870 between the parliament and the monarch, it became clear that the monarch was lower in rank compared to the parliament. Since then the parliament fulfilled the role of a monarch, but then more democratically. The electoral system made its first appearance in 1918. Before that, a majority system was used for voting. People got the chance to vote for their parliament, but only the ones that were men and those who had enough money. In 1917 this changed due to the introduction of universal suffrage, which meant every man could vote, no strings were attached anymore. Women were given the chance to vote two years later in 1919. In this year another big step to democracy was taken. Everyone who was old enough to vote could vote now. And this is how our political system slowly grew to the one we now have today.<br>
			<h2>The characteristics of our constitution and how it has developed over the years</h2>
			The Dutch constitution exists since 1814. In the constitution, all fundamental rights have been written down, for example, the right to freedom and equality. Over time, the constitution has developed enormously to the laws we now have today. An important law is the one made by Thorbecke in 1848, which gave the citizens of The Netherlands more power and the monarch less power. It also enabled us to vote for our leaders for the first time. It took almost 70 years to enable voting for everyone. In 1917 all men were allowed to vote, and in 1919 also women were allowed to vote. Before these new laws, only men with enough money were allowed to vote. Another major development in our constitution was made by Meneer Drees in 1948, a few years after World War 2. It gave people who were 65+ and retired money, so they were able to have a nice retirement without money problems. Especially, after the Second World War many old people lost everything and were not able to work anymore. The AOW helped these people with money, which was financed by all the Dutch working citizens. We can conclude that the Dutch constitution helped people a lot. They have given the Dutch citizens more equality and rights. Furthermore, the Dutch constitution shows that the Dutch society cares for one another.<br>
			<h2>The origin of our welfare state and how it developed. What are the charcteristics of our present welfare state?</h2>
			In the time of farmers all people living in The Netherlands needed to take care of themselves, nobody was helping one another. In the 19th century, the first monarch came to power in The Netherlands. He decided what happened in the country and people needed to listen to him. But over time a constitution law was made which gave the power back to the people of The Netherlands. In the years to follow many laws were made up and accepted. They gave people more rights and more equality. Especially when the AOW was introduced in 1948. It made clear that the Dutch people were okay with helping others in need. We help other people in need as we know they would do the same in return. That makes our welfare state unique and something to be proud of as a Dutch citizen. The constitution nowadays shows how wealthy our country is and how we have got everything fixed, with healthcare, equality and education. And how much we care about other people.<br>
			<h2>Which political ideologies and national political parties are represented in our Second Chamber</h2>
			In Second Chamber we have got 16 parties now. Those parties can be divided into three major ideologies. Every topic in The Netherlands divides the parties into left, middle or right ideologies. Sometimes a party is right and sometimes more left, but each party has a more left or right ideology. GL, SP, PvdA, BIJ1, PvdA, Denk, D66, CU and Volt are more left wing parties, their ideology is more progressive. They want more equality amongst the citizens, so wealthy people need to share their wealth by paying more taxes. Some of these parties are more left than others, but they have in general a more progressive ideology. VVD, PVV, FvdD, BBB, CDA, 50plus, SGP and JA21 are more right wing parties, their ideology is more conservative, They want more individual responsibility. Everyone is responsible for their own health and income. Some of these parties are more right than others, but they have in general a conservative ideology. In some topics, a party changes sides from left to right or right to left. But most of the time that is an exception and not permanent for every topic.
