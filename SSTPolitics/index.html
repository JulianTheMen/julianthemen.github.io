			<h2>What is the meaning of the distinction between left-wing, centre and right-wing? Why is it sometimes hard to make this distinction?</h2>
			In the political spectrum you have two certain sides, in this case left-wing and right wing. The spectrum speaks about what view you have for politics; it defines your opinion. The political definition of left-wing is refereeing to a certain group whose opinion tends to be more liberal and usually support more progressive policy. In contrast to right-wing, which is more conservative. Centre means that is in the middle of both, a combination between liberal and conservative opinions. It is sometimes quite hard to distinguish them from each other because those 3 forms of ideologies have always got something in common and they are sometimes hard to recognize.  
			The main difference between progressive and conservative is that progressive looks at the new developments and change, while conservatives like to go back to the past and don’t change. The two ideologies have also major differences in ideas of things. A good example is the climate change, conservatives don’t really want to invest into the climate whilst the progressivists support the idea of investing in the climate.<br>
			<h2>What stood out in the electons of 2021?</h2>
			The Dutch elections of 2021 was kind of a rollercoaster, with lots of drama and trouble. Most of the votes were mainly centred and the biggest political party was VVD, that is centre-right on the political spectrum.  As usual some parties suffered great losses (groenlinks) while others huge victories (D66). 
			The cabinet formation was quite the issue, after a huge number of days, 300 days, the formation of Rutte IV was formed. The VVD worked together with: D66, CDA and CU. You may not know this, but all those political parties are more centred in the political spectrum. The main difference is in the are the progressive and conservative views of the parties. D66 is extremely progressive while the CU tends to be quite conservative.
			It was still at question if Mark Rutte would score good as a candidate, after all there was a lot of trouble last few years with him. Even very recently the childcare benefits scandal. Anyhow, Rutte managed to stay on top with a staggering 20 % of the voters, that is 2 million people who voted for Mark Rutte as prime minister.<br>
			<h2>How does our electoral system work? Is it different from other systems?</h2>
			The electoral system is a certain political system that a country has. The Netherlands has a proportional representation electoral system. The system works quite straight forward, every 4 years in March there is the election for the representatives of a party. To receive a seat in the second chambre you need at least 0,67% of the votes. If you have a seat in the chambre, you have a say in all the decisions that the second chambre makes, the more seats you have the more power you got. Besides the party you can vote on, you can also vote on a certain representative. When you vote you will get a white piece of paper with multiple parties on it, then also a list of the representatives on whom you can vote as well. Everyone in the Netherlands can make a political party, but to be able to stand on the final piece of vote paper (also called a ballot) you have to pay a registration fee of 450,- euro to be able to participate for the election for the second chambre. 
			Other countries have different kinds of electoral system, take an example of France. In France they have got a district electoral system. You will have multiple districts in a country, you could compare them to provinces (like what we have in the Netherlands). Every district will have a certain representative seat, so in every district there will be an election for one seat in the parliament. The party with the most districts as their favourable choice will be prime minister.<br>
			<h2>What are the main themes of our present cabinet?</h2>
			To say that climate change is nowadays a big issue is a fact, as well as in politics they have difficulties facing it. And thus, it was one of the main topics for the ‘’regeerakkoord’’ with multiple opinions clashing into each other, the progressive mind of D66 which supports the climate change investments. While the VVD tends to be more in favour of keeping the side of the companies and their profitable greenhouse effects. Like coal industries. And so, you have quite the debate about climate. Eventually they settled, and a major fund was brought out to support the climate change agreement.
			Furthermore, healthcare, and international affairs were some important bullet points. The health care especially during this time, covid-19. A severe problem for the coming time. And the international affairs play an important role. The EU deals and immigrant rules those were some tight issues for this current cabinet.
