				<div class="col"><h2>More greenery and a healthier climate</h2><div class="imgtext"><p>In the coming years around 35.000 new trees must be placed to make our township greener. Over the past few years, many trees were cut down for houses, but this has to change. Also, a lot of trees were replaced by parking spots.</p></div><img src="groen.jpeg"></div>
				<div class="col"><h2>More housing in sustainable ways</h2><div class="imgtext"><p>Every township has house shortages and our next generation must be able to afford a house in our township against low costs. We cannot keep delaying this any longer. Our children are growing up faster than you might think.</p></div><img src="housing.jpg"></div>
				<div class="col"><h2>Even better healthcare and eldercare</h2><div class="imgtext"><p>We all want the best care for our father and mother, so we must be invested in healthcare every year to make that happen. When you are old you also want good quality healthcare. Especially in townships, there are not enough facilities for older people. This has to change in the near future.</p></div><img src="ziekenhuis.jpg"></div>

				<div class="col"><h2>Refugee solutions which suit our community well</h2><div class="imgtext"><p>We all feel sympathy for the refugees and giving them a roof above their heads is the least we can do. They risked everything coming here and should be rewarded for that. If we were standing in their shoes we would aspect the same of them.</p></div><img src="vluchtelingen.jpg"></div>
				<div class="col"><h2>Reduced number of flights to Schiphol</h2><div class="imgtext"><p>We all hear those noises of airplanes flying over our township. A few planes are fine, but it only becomes more and more and we must act now. All those planes cause too much noise and waste. Animals can not sleep well and some of them die. Animals are important for biodiversity and are beautiful to see. It is a waste to see them die without trying to stop it from happening.</p></div><img src="schiphol.jpg"></div>

			<h1>Our ideologies</h1>
			<p>
				Our ideologies are mostly central and progressive.<br> We want to be progressive because in our ideal plan we are going to change the future. We will be doing this by using new technologies and also by investing in the environment.<br>
				We are central because we have both right and left winged opinions. For instance, take housing problems. We have a rather right-winged opinion about that, we want to build more and cheaper houses and would like to invest more in companies. However, we would also like to invest more in our ''green'' future. To make sure climate change will not be that high of an impact.
				Environmentalism, As we have mentioned in the previous paragraph, we support the idea of Environmentalism. This means that our beliefs are that we have to invest in our coming future and reduce expences on big anti-environmental companies, like oil industrie and gas.
